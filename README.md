# Snake Client Project

Snake game is a very popular video game. It is a video game concept where the player maneuvers a dot and grows it by â€˜eatingâ€™ pieces of food. As it moves and eats, it grows and the growing snake becomes an obstacle to smooth maneuvers.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.

## How to play
